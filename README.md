## Overview
This is a **3D-printable protector** designed for **OBDLink MX+** to prevent the pairing button from physical damage and breakage.  

I created this protector after accidentally breaking my **OBDLink MX+** and receiving an exceptionally kind replacement from OBDLink.com support.
I’m sharing it in appreciation for their outstanding service and to help prevent the same damage from happening again.

## Features
- ✅ Protects the fragile pairing button from accidental pressure or impact  
- ✅ Easy to install — no modification to the device required  
- ✅ Reduces direct access to the button to help prevent breakage.  
- ✅ Compatible with OBDLink MX+ (check dimensions below)  
- ✅ Fully open-source under the MIT License
